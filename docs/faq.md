# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What does AID stand for?
**AI-Integrated Development.** "Integrated" captures the core philosophy: human and AI co-execute every phase. Not "AI-driven" (human is the pilot) and not "AI-assisted" (AI does more than assist).

### How is AID different from SDD (Spec-Driven Development)?
SDD covers spec→code. AID covers problem→production→maintenance. AID contains SDD as one layer (phases 3-6) and adds discovery, requirements gathering, multi-level planning, post-deployment monitoring, and formal feedback loops. See the [comparison table](../README.md#aid-vs-sdd).

### Is this just Waterfall rebranded?
Yes — and that's the point. Waterfall's phases were sound. Waterfall failed because humans were too slow to execute them with rigor. Agile solved that by dropping the rigor. AI changes the economics: discovery takes hours not weeks, going back costs tokens not sprints. The rigor becomes viable again.

### Do I need all 12 phases?
No. Use what applies:
- **Greenfield project with clear requirements?** Skip Discover, start at Interview.
- **Quick bug fix?** Skip to Correct→Implement→Review→Deploy.
- **Spike/prototype?** Use Discover→Specify→Implement. Skip planning and formal review.

The phases are a menu, not a checklist. But know what you're skipping and why.

## Adoption

### What AI tools does AID work with?
Any agent that can read files and write code: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Aider, or custom agents. The skills are tool-agnostic — they're instruction documents, not plugins.

### How do I use the skills?
Load the relevant SKILL.md as system context or initial prompt for your AI agent. For example:
- Starting a new feature? Load `aid-specify/SKILL.md` and give the agent your requirements.
- Reviewing a PR? Load `aid-review/SKILL.md` and point the agent at the diff.

### Can I use AID with a team, not just solo?
Yes. The Knowledge Base and formal artifacts (SPEC.md, GAP.md, IMPEDIMENT.md) are designed for team collaboration. Multiple people can work on different phases simultaneously. The artifacts are the coordination mechanism.

### How long does adoption take?
Start with one delivery. Use the templates. See if the structure helps. Most teams report that Discovery alone (building the KB) pays for itself within the first week — every subsequent task is faster because the context is documented.

## Technical

### What's the Knowledge Base?
Up to 13 markdown documents that capture the living understanding of a project: architecture, module map, technology stack, data model, API contracts, integration map, domain glossary, coding standards, test landscape, security model, tech debt, infrastructure, and open questions. See [templates/knowledge-base/](../templates/knowledge-base/).

### What are feedback loops?
Formal pathways for a downstream phase to revise upstream artifacts. When implementation reveals the spec was wrong, you don't silently work around it — you create an IMPEDIMENT.md that triggers a spec revision. There are 11 loops total. See the [methodology document](../methodology/aid-methodology.md#4-feedback-loops).

### What's the Grade A gate?
A quality validation step used in agent-generated output. It checks source data match (1% tolerance), traceability (all numbers trace to known sources), consistency (cross-reference between outputs), completeness (required sections present), and no-zeros (no placeholder values). Failed outputs are regenerated, not patched.

### How do I handle the "spec was wrong" problem?
That's what feedback loops are for. When implementation discovers a spec error:
1. Create `IMPEDIMENT.md` describing what the spec assumed vs. what's true
2. Route back to the appropriate phase (Specify, Plan, or Discover)
3. Revise the upstream artifact with a formal change record
4. Resume implementation from the corrected spec

The impediment artifact creates an audit trail. You can always answer "why did this change?"
