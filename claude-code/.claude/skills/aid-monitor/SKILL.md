# Observe, Classify, Act

Monitor production. Detect what's wrong. Route it to where it gets fixed.

## Argument-Hint

```
/aid-monitor work-NNN
```

Required: work ID. If only one work exists, auto-select it.

Optional flags:
- `--since "YYYY-MM-DD"` — observation window start (default: last deploy or last monitor run)
- `--package package-NNN` — scope to a specific deployment package

## Workspace

```
.aid/{work}/
  MONITOR-STATE.md             ← process (observation log, finding statuses)
  packages/                    ← deployment history
  features/                    ← SPECs (expected behavior)
  tasks/                       ← task files (acceptance criteria)
  known-issues.md              ← known problems
```

## Pre-flight

1. Verify `.aid/` workspace exists.
2. Resolve work directory.
3. Read or create `MONITOR-STATE.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Monitor State

   ## Last Run
   Date: {never}
   Window: {start} → {end}
   Findings: 0

   ## Active Findings
   {none}

   ## Resolved Findings
   {none}
   ```
4. Read `PLAN.md` — understand deliveries and what was shipped.
5. Read `packages/` — what's deployed and when.
6. Read `known-issues.md` — filter out already-known problems.

## Inputs

**From the project (what to observe):**
Any combination of: error tracking (Sentry, AppInsights, CloudWatch), CI/CD results,
APM/performance metrics, test trends, user feedback, support tickets, log files.

**From AID artifacts (what's expected):**
- Feature SPECs (`.aid/{work}/features/*/SPEC.md`) — expected behavior
- Task files (`.aid/{work}/tasks/task-*.md`) — acceptance criteria
- Package files — what was deployed and when
- `known-issues.md` — exclude known problems

**From KB (context):**
Read `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md`, pull relevant docs (typically architecture, module-map,
infrastructure, test-landscape) for baseline context and root cause analysis.

## Process

### Step 1: Observe

Pull data from configured sources. Scope the observation window:
- **Post-deploy:** last deploy → now
- **Scheduled:** last monitor run → now
- **On-demand:** user-specified window

For each data source, capture:
- Raw signals (errors, latency spikes, failures, ticket clusters)
- Metadata (timestamps, affected users/endpoints, frequency)
- Trends vs. baseline (is this new? worsening? stable?)

**Anomaly detection — compare to baseline:**
- Error rate changes (new error types, rate spikes)
- Performance degradation (latency, throughput)
- Test instability (new flaky tests, persistent failures)
- Behavioral anomalies (unexpected patterns in usage or data)

**Correlation — connect signals:**
- "Error spike started 23 min after deploy of package-002"
- "Performance drop coincides with new region traffic"
- Correlation narrows investigation scope — don't just list, connect.

Use KB to filter: known conditions, expected variation, already-documented issues.

### Step 2: Classify

For each finding above threshold:

```
Does code do what the feature SPEC says?
├── NO → BUG (spec right, code wrong)
├── YES, spec doesn't cover this case →
│     Obvious fix? → BUG (spec gap)
│     Needs requirements input? → CHANGE REQUEST
├── YES, spec is now wrong → CHANGE REQUEST
├── NOT CODE → INFRASTRUCTURE
└── FALSE POSITIVE → NO ACTION
```

Assess severity per finding:
- **Critical:** Data loss, security breach, total outage → Immediate
- **High:** Core functionality broken → Same day
- **Medium:** Non-critical affected, workaround exists → This week
- **Low:** Minor, limited impact → Next cycle

### Step 3: Analyze (BUGs only)

Root cause analysis before routing:

1. **Reproduce the path.** Trace from evidence: endpoint → module → function.
2. **Identify the fault.** What specific code is wrong?
3. **Understand why.** Spec ambiguous? Edge case? KB assumption wrong?
4. **Assess blast radius.** Check module consumers via INDEX.md → module-map.
5. **Define patch scope.** Exactly which files change. Minimal surface — fix the bug, don't refactor.
6. **Test requirements.** Fix verification + regression + coverage gap.

Root cause = one sentence:
"The `PaymentService.Process()` method doesn't validate null `currency` field,
which spec says must default to USD."

### Step 4: Propose Actions

Present findings to the user with proposed routing:

```
📊 Monitor Report — work-001 (since 2026-03-20)

Finding 1: [CRITICAL] [BUG] Null currency causes 500 error
  Evidence: 342 errors in 48h, payment module, started after package-002
  Root cause: PaymentService.Process() missing null validation
  Patch scope: PaymentService.cs + PaymentServiceTests.cs
  → Proposed: Create task in delivery-hotfix → aid-execute

Finding 2: [MEDIUM] [CHANGE REQUEST] Reports need local timezone
  Evidence: 12 support tickets requesting midnight-local instead of midnight-UTC
  → Proposed: Route to aid-discover → new work cycle

Finding 3: [LOW] [NO ACTION] Intermittent 504 on health endpoint
  Evidence: 3 occurrences in 7 days, all self-resolved < 30s
  → Proposed: Document, no action

[1] Approve all routes
[2] Adjust — change routing for specific findings
```

### Step 5: Act

For each approved finding:

**BUG → aid-execute (short path):**
- Create a new task file in `.aid/{work}/tasks/` with type IMPLEMENT
- Include: root cause, patch scope, test requirements, severity
- The task goes through the normal execute cycle (code → review → done)

**CHANGE REQUEST → aid-discover:**
- Write a Q&A entry to `DISCOVERY-STATE.md` § Pending Q&A describing the gap
- Optionally create a new work if scope is large enough

**INFRASTRUCTURE → escalate:**
- Document in MONITOR-STATE.md with recommended ops action
- Not in AID's scope — human handles this

**NO ACTION → close:**
- Document justification in MONITOR-STATE.md → Resolved Findings

**Update known-issues.md** if findings reveal new known issues affecting other features.

### Step 6: Update State

- MONITOR-STATE.md § Last Run → update date, window, finding count
- MONITOR-STATE.md § Active Findings → add unresolved findings with status
- MONITOR-STATE.md § Resolved Findings → move closed findings here
- If PM tool configured (infrastructure.md § Project Management):
  - Create tickets for BUG tasks
  - Link to existing Sprint/Epic

## Severity Thresholds

| Signal | Threshold | Classification |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| New error type | Any | Finding |
| Error rate increase | >200% baseline | Finding |
| Performance degradation | >50% latency | Finding |
| Persistent test failure | Any new | Finding |
| Support ticket cluster | 3+ same issue | Finding |
| Below all thresholds | — | Clean report, no findings |

## Re-run

When MONITOR-STATE.md has prior findings:
1. Show active findings and their current status.
2. Show observation history (last runs).
3. Ask: **[1] New observation** (fresh run) or **[2] Review finding-N** (check if resolved)?
4. If [1] → Step 1 with new window (previous run end → now).
5. If [2] → Re-check evidence for that specific finding, update status.
