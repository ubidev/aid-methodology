# Detail — The Ultimate Breakdown

Break each deliverable from PLAN.md into small, sequential, testable tasks.
Each task = one agent session = one PR = one human review.

## The Loop

Each deliverable follows the same cycle:

```
1. PROPOSE  → agent proposes task breakdown for a deliverable
2. DISCUSS  → developer and agent refine (size, scope, sequence, criteria)
3. WRITE    → save agreed tasks to files
4. REVIEW   → grade tasks against SPEC/PLAN — pass? next deliverable. fail? back to 1.
```

**Re-run = enter at step 4 with existing tasks.**

## Workspace

```
.aid/
  knowledge/                ← shared KB (read)
  work-NNN-{name}/
    PLAN.md                 ← roadmap with deliverables (read — must exist)
    features/
      feature-NNN-{name}/
        SPEC.md             ← per-feature tech spec (read)
    tasks/                  ← OUTPUT: sequential task files
      task-001.md
      task-002.md
      ...
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `work-NNN` | Detail a specific work. Required if multiple works exist. |
| *(no arg)* | Auto-selects if only one work exists. |
| `--reset` | Delete all files in `tasks/` and start fresh. |

## Pre-flight

### Check 1: Locate Work

1. If arg provided → use that work directory
2. If single work exists → auto-select
3. If multiple works → list them, ask user to choose
4. If no works → **STOP.** "No works found. Run `/aid-interview` first."

### Check 2: Verify PLAN.md Exists

1. Check for `.aid/{work}/PLAN.md`
2. If missing → **STOP.** "No PLAN.md found. Run `/aid-plan` first."

### Check 3: Verify Not in Plan Mode

- ✅ `Default` or `Auto-accept edits` → Proceed.
- ❌ `Plan mode` → **STOP.**

### Check 4: Detect State

- `tasks/` empty or missing → **FIRST RUN** (Step 1)
- `tasks/` has files → **REVIEW** (enter loop at step 4)

## Inputs

- **PLAN.md** — deliverables, ordering, dependencies
- **Feature SPECs** — all `features/*/SPEC.md` within the work
- **KB via INDEX.md** — Read `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md`, use summaries to pull
  relevant docs (typically architecture, module-map, coding-standards — but let the INDEX guide you)

## The Rules

1. **Always small.** Every task fits one agent session. If it doesn't, split it.
2. **Sequential within a deliverable.** Each builds on the previous.
3. **Each task = one PR.** Human reviews and merges before next task starts.
4. **No new decisions.** Everything is already in PLAN + SPECs. Detail just slices.

## Task Types

Every task has exactly ONE type. Never mix types in a single task.

| Type | What it produces | When Detail creates it |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **RESEARCH** | Findings document, comparison, recommendation | Feature has `Spike Needed` in STATE.md, or unknowns need investigation |
| **DESIGN** | Mockups, wireframes, interaction flows | Feature has UI Specs in SPEC.md |
| **IMPLEMENT** | Code + unit tests | Feature has Data Model / Feature Flow / Layers in SPEC.md |
| **TEST** | Integration/E2E/UI/load tests + results | Feature has integration points or testable acceptance criteria |
| **DOCUMENT** | ADRs, API docs, runbooks, diagrams | Significant architectural decision or complex setup |
| **MIGRATE** | Migration scripts + rollback + runbook | Feature has data model changes affecting existing data |
| **REFACTOR** | Restructured code, same behavior | Feature requires restructuring before implementation |
| **CONFIGURE** | Config files, CI/CD, infra-as-code | Feature requires environment or infrastructure setup |

### Type Detection Rules

When proposing tasks, the agent reads the feature SPEC and automatically detects types:

1. **Spike Needed** in feature STATE.md → RESEARCH task first
2. **UI Specs** section in SPEC.md → DESIGN task before IMPLEMENT
3. **Data Model / Feature Flow / Layers & Components** → IMPLEMENT task(s)
4. **Integration points / acceptance criteria** → TEST task(s) after IMPLEMENT
5. **Major architectural decision** → DOCUMENT task (ADR)
6. **Data model changes to existing tables/collections** → MIGRATE task before IMPLEMENT
7. **Code restructuring needed before feature work** → REFACTOR task first
8. **Environment/config setup required** → CONFIGURE task early in sequence

### Type Separation Rule

**One task = one type. No exceptions.**

If the agent proposes a task that mixes types, it must split:
- ❌ "Build login form + write E2E tests" → split into IMPLEMENT + TEST
- ❌ "Research auth + implement auth" → split into RESEARCH + IMPLEMENT
- ❌ "Migrate schema + update code" → split into MIGRATE + IMPLEMENT

### Natural Ordering Within a Delivery

Default sequence (the agent proposes this, user can reorder):

```
RESEARCH → DESIGN → CONFIGURE → MIGRATE → REFACTOR → IMPLEMENT → TEST → DOCUMENT
```

Not rigid. Not all types appear in every delivery. The user adjusts during discussion.

## Task File Format

```markdown
# task-{id}: {Title}

**Type:** RESEARCH | DESIGN | IMPLEMENT | TEST | DOCUMENT | MIGRATE | REFACTOR | CONFIGURE

**Source:** feature-NNN-{name} → delivery-{x}

**Scope:**
- {what to produce or modify — depends on type}

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1 — concrete, testable
- [ ] Criterion 2 — concrete, testable
```

Five sections. Nothing else.

**Quality gate cascade:** Every task inherits:
1. **Project baseline** from REQUIREMENTS.md §6 (unit test minimum, linting standard)
2. **Feature-specific requirements** from the SPEC.md quality sections (if any)

Include these in Acceptance Criteria when writing tasks. Don't repeat the
full baseline — reference it: "All §6 quality gates pass." Add feature-specific
criteria explicitly when the SPEC calls for them (e.g., "explicit tests for
all 5 auth edge cases per SPEC").

**Type-specific default criteria:** The agent adds these unless the task explicitly overrides:
- IMPLEMENT: "Unit tests for all new public methods/endpoints" + "All existing tests still pass" + "Build passes"
- TEST: "Tests are deterministic" + "Clean setup/teardown" + "All acceptance criteria from source feature covered"
- MIGRATE: "Migration is reversible" + "Migration is idempotent" + "Data integrity verified"
- REFACTOR: "All tests pass before AND after" + "No behavior change"
- CONFIGURE: "Configuration is idempotent" + "No plaintext secrets"
- RESEARCH: "At least 2 alternatives compared" + "Sources cited" + "Actionable recommendation"
- DESIGN: "Design system tokens used" + "Responsive behavior shown (if applicable)"
- DOCUMENT: "Accuracy verified against current codebase"

## FIRST RUN — The Loop

### Step 1: Propose Tasks for First Deliverable

Read the first deliverable from PLAN.md. Identify its features, read their SPECs.
Propose a sequential task breakdown:

```
**delivery-001: {Name}**

I'm proposing {n} tasks:

1. **task-001: {title}** [RESEARCH]
   Scope: {brief description}
   Criteria: {brief summary}

2. **task-002: {title}** [DESIGN]
   Scope: {brief description}
   Criteria: {brief summary}

3. **task-003: {title}** [IMPLEMENT]
   Scope: {brief description}
   Criteria: {brief summary}

4. **task-004: {title}** [TEST]
   Scope: {brief description}
   Criteria: {brief summary}

What do you think? We can discuss:
- **Type** — should any task be a different type? Am I mixing types?
- **Size** — is any task too big or too small?
- **Scope** — should something move between tasks?
- **Sequence** — is the order right?
- **Criteria** — are the acceptance criteria concrete enough?
```

### Step 2: Discuss

The developer may:
- **Retype** → "task-002 should be MIGRATE not IMPLEMENT"
- **Split** → "task-002 is too big, separate the migration from the model"
- **Merge** → "003 and 004 are tiny, combine them" (only if SAME type)
- **Reorder** → "swap 002 and 003 — need the service first"
- **Scope change** → "task-001 should also include the config file"
- **Criteria change** → "add index creation to task-001's criteria"
- **Approve** → "looks good"

⚠️ **Merge rule:** only merge tasks of the same type. Never merge across types.

Respond to each concern, re-present affected tasks. Loop until approved.

### Step 3: Write and Review

Once approved:
1. Write task files to `.aid/{work}/tasks/`
2. **Review immediately:** Do the tasks hold up?
   - Does each task have what it needs from the previous?
   - Any gap where something is used before it's created?
   - Scope aligned with what the SPECs actually say?
   - Criteria concrete enough to verify?

Use the universal rubric (`../templates/grading-rubric.md`). Classify each issue
by severity. The grade is calculated — worst issue dominates.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Grade ≥ minimum (from DISCOVERY-STATE.md) | Move to next deliverable. |
| Grade < minimum, fixable | Back to Propose with findings. |

```
✅ delivery-001 tasks written and verified — sequence holds, criteria testable.
Moving to delivery-002.
```

### Step 4: Next Deliverable

Move to next deliverable → same loop (steps 1–3). Task numbering is global
across all deliverables (task-001 through task-N).

### Step 5: Final Summary

```
All tasks written:

delivery-001: {Name} → tasks 001–004
delivery-002: {Name} → tasks 005–008

Total: {n} tasks in {m} deliverables.
```

## REVIEW (re-run on existing tasks)

`tasks/` has files and were previously completed.

**Ask first:** _"Tasks for this work are already complete. Do you want to reopen for review?
Is there something specific you want to re-examine?"_

If user confirms → continue below.
If user has a specific concern → record it as context for the review.

Enter **the same loop at step 4** — review tasks against
current PLAN.md and SPECs.

### Load Current State

Re-read PLAN.md, all feature SPECs, all existing task files.

### Review Each Deliverable's Tasks

For each deliverable, check its corresponding tasks:

1. **PLAN.md changed** — deliverables added, removed, resequenced?
2. **SPECs changed** — feature content updated since tasks were written?
3. **Orphan tasks** — tasks referencing deliverables/features that no longer exist?
4. **Missing tasks** — new deliverables/features with no corresponding tasks?
5. **Sequence broken** — task order invalid given changes?

### Grade Overall

Use the universal rubric (`../templates/grading-rubric.md`). Classify each issue
by severity. The grade is calculated — worst issue dominates.

Compare to minimum grade from DISCOVERY-STATE.md.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Grade ≥ minimum | Print summary, done. |
| Grade < minimum, tasks fixable | List findings, re-enter loop for affected deliverables. |
| Grade < minimum, most tasks orphaned | Recommend `--reset`. |

For grades below minimum: re-enter the loop for affected deliverables.
Update task files, create new ones, delete orphans, renumber if needed.

- **→ Plan:** Plan too vague to decompose → return to `/aid-plan`
- **→ Specify:** SPEC missing detail for scope → write Q&A to feature's `STATE.md`
