# AID for Claude Code

Use the `setup.sh` (or `setup.ps1` on Windows) script at the repo root to install AID into your project, or copy manually:

## Setup

```bash
# Automated (recommended)
path/to/aid-methodology/setup.sh /path/to/your/project

# Manual
cp -r path/to/aid-methodology/claude-code/.claude  .claude/
cp path/to/aid-methodology/claude-code/AGENTS.md   AGENTS.md
cp path/to/aid-methodology/claude-code/CLAUDE.md   CLAUDE.md
```

This gives you:
- `.claude/skills/aid-{phase}/SKILL.md` — Phase instructions in AgentSkills format (11 skills)
- `.claude/agents/{name}.md` — Agent definitions in Claude Code format (13 agents)
- `AGENTS.md` — Project context for AI agents (edit with your project details)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code configuration (edit with your project details)

## Skills

11 phase skills, one per AID phase. See [`.claude/skills/README.md`](.claude/skills/README.md) for the full list.

## Usage

### Skills
Skills are loaded automatically when matched by description. Each SKILL.md contains YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields that Claude Code uses for skill selection.

### Agents
Agent files define specialized roles with constrained tool access and focused system prompts. Use them to delegate specific phases of the AID pipeline.

## File Format

- **Skills:** Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description` required) — lives in `.claude/skills/`
- **Agents:** Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `maxTurns`) — lives in `.claude/agents/`

## Notes

- Skills are optimized for LLM context windows — concise, no verbose explanations
- Human-readable documentation lives in the repo's `skills/` and `agents/` directories
- Templates live in the repo's `templates/` directory — reference them from your project
