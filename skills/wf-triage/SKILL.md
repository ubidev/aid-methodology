# Classification & Routing

When Track detects something, Triage decides what it is and where it goes. This is the routing decision that determines whether a fix takes four phases or ten.

## Core Principle

**The classification determines the path. Get it right.** A bug misclassified as a CR wastes a full development cycle on something that needed a patch. A CR misclassified as a bug produces a band-aid that breaks when requirements shift again. The distinction is precise: does the code match the spec? If no → bug. If yes, but the spec is wrong → CR.

## Inputs

- `TRACK-REPORT.md` — findings from production monitoring.
- `SPEC.md` — the specification of expected behavior.
- `knowledge/` directory — system context for analysis.
- `TASK-{id}.md` files — acceptance criteria for relevant features.

## Process

### Step 1: Read the Finding

For each finding in the Track Report above the severity threshold:
- What was observed? (Concrete symptoms.)
- What evidence supports it? (Metrics, logs, reproduction steps.)
- What's the impact? (Users, functionality, data integrity.)

### Step 2: Classify

Apply this decision tree:

```
Does the code do what SPEC.md says it should?
├── NO → BUG
│     The spec is right. The code is wrong.
│     Route to wf-correct (short path).
│
├── YES, but the spec doesn't cover this case → BUG (spec gap)
│     The spec didn't specify edge case behavior.
│     If the correct behavior is obvious → wf-correct.
│     If the correct behavior needs requirements input → CR.
│
├── YES, and the spec is now wrong → CHANGE REQUEST
│     Business rules changed. Users need different behavior.
│     The system works as designed; the design needs to change.
│     Route to wf-discover (new cycle).
│
├── NOT A CODE ISSUE → INFRASTRUCTURE
│     Server misconfiguration, scaling limits, third-party outage.
│     Escalate to ops. Outside AID scope.
│
└── FALSE POSITIVE → NO ACTION
      Expected behavior, already resolved, below threshold.
      Close with justification.
```

### Step 3: Assess Severity

| Severity | Criteria | Expected Response Time |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Critical** | Data loss, security breach, total service outage | Immediate |
| **High** | Core functionality broken for significant user segment | Same day |
| **Medium** | Non-critical functionality affected, workaround exists | This week |
| **Low** | Minor issue, limited impact, easy workaround | Next sprint |

### Step 4: Route

Based on classification:

**BUG → wf-correct (short path)**
The bug enters the correction phase. Correct does root cause analysis and maps the patch. Then: Implement → Review → Test → Deploy. Five phases total. No re-specification, no re-planning.

**Change Request → wf-discover (new cycle)**
The CR enters as a new project. If the system has an existing KB, discovery is targeted (update what changed). If it's a significant feature, it runs the full pipeline: Discover → Interview → Specify → Plan → Detail → Implement → Review → Test → Deploy.

**Infrastructure → ops escalation**
Document the finding, recommended action, and escalate. Track this outside the AID pipeline.

**No Action → close**
Document the justification for closing. Reference evidence that shows the finding is benign.

### Step 5: Document

Generate `TRIAGE.md` using the [template](references/triage-template.md). Every classification must include:
- The finding (what was detected).
- The classification (bug/CR/infra/no-action).
- The evidence (why this classification, not another).
- The routing decision (where it goes next).
- The severity assessment.

## The Hard Calls

### Bug vs. CR

The distinction hinges on the spec:

**Bug example:** SPEC says "API returns 200 with user data for valid requests." API returns 500 for users with special characters in their name. The spec is right; the code doesn't handle the edge case. → **BUG.**

**CR example:** SPEC says "Reports generated daily at midnight UTC." Client now operates in multiple timezones and needs reports at midnight *local time* per region. The code does exactly what the spec says. The spec needs to change. → **CR.**

**Gray area:** SPEC says "support file upload." Users try to upload 2GB files and it crashes. Did the spec implicitly assume reasonable file sizes? Is the missing size limit a spec gap (bug) or a new requirement (CR)?

Rule of thumb: if the fix is obvious and contained (add a size check, return a helpful error), treat it as a bug. If it requires stakeholder input to define the correct behavior (what's the max size? should we support chunked upload?), treat it as a CR.

### Severity Disagreement

Track may assess severity differently than Triage. Track sees metrics; Triage has spec context. Triage severity overrides Track severity, with justification documented.

## Output: TRIAGE.md

See [Triage Template](references/triage-template.md) for the full template.

## Triggers

### → wf-correct (Loop 8)
When classification is BUG, produce TRIAGE.md and hand off to `wf-correct` for root cause analysis and patch mapping.

### → wf-discover (Loop 9)
When classification is Change Request, produce TRIAGE.md and route to `wf-discover` as a new project cycle. The CR becomes the input to discovery (or interview, for greenfield).
