# Brownfield Codebase Discovery

Analyze an existing codebase and produce a structured Knowledge Base (`.aid/knowledge/` directory) that becomes the gravitational center of the project.

## When to Use

- **Full discovery:** New brownfield project. No KB exists yet.
- **Targeted discovery:** A downstream phase (aid-interview, aid-specify, aid-plan, aid-detail, aid-implement, aid-implement (built-in review), aid-test) generated a GAP.md with `discovery-needed`. Only analyze the specific area identified in the gap.

## Inputs

- Access to the codebase (local path, git repo URL, or archive).
- For targeted discovery: the GAP.md or IMPEDIMENT.md that triggered re-entry.

## Process

### Step 1: Structure Scan

Detect project type and map the codebase layout.

```bash
# Detect project type
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "*.csproj" -o -name "*.sln" -o -name "pom.xml" \
  -o -name "package.json" -o -name "Cargo.toml" -o -name "go.mod" \
  -o -name "*.py" -o -name "Gemfile" | head -20

# Map folder structure
tree -L 3 -d --gitignore

# Count by language
find . -type f | grep -E '\.(cs|java|py|ts|js|go|rs)$' | \
  sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

Record in `.aid/knowledge/architecture.md`: project type, approximate size, age (from git log), entry points, build system.

### Step 2: Architecture Analysis

Identify patterns, layers, and boundaries.

- Look for standard patterns: MVVM, CQRS, Clean Architecture, Layered, Microservices.
- Map module boundaries: what depends on what.
- Trace data flow: entry point → processing → storage → output.
- Identify the dependency injection/service registration pattern.

Record in `.aid/knowledge/architecture.md`.

### Step 3: Stack Inventory

Catalog all technologies.

```bash
# .NET
dotnet --list-sdks 2>/dev/null; cat global.json 2>/dev/null
# Node
cat package.json | jq '.dependencies, .devDependencies' 2>/dev/null
# Java
cat pom.xml | grep -A1 '<dependency>' 2>/dev/null
# Python
cat requirements.txt pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null
```

Record in `.aid/knowledge/technology-stack.md`: languages, frameworks, versions, package managers, runtime.

### Step 4: Convention Mining

Infer coding standards from the code itself (not from documentation that may be outdated).

- Naming patterns (PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case for what).
- Error handling (exceptions, Result types, error codes).
- Logging patterns (which framework, structured vs unstructured).
- Configuration management (env vars, config files, secrets).
- File organization conventions.

Record in `.aid/knowledge/coding-standards.md`. Mark as "inferred from code" — these need human confirmation.

### Step 5: Module Mapping

For every significant module/package:

| Module | Purpose | Dependencies | Approx Size | Test Coverage |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... files | Tested/Untested |

Record in `.aid/knowledge/module-map.md`.

### Step 6: Data Model Extraction

- Schema: tables/collections, columns/fields, types.
- Relationships: foreign keys, navigation properties, indexes.
- Migrations: migration history, current version.

```bash
# EF Core
find . -path "*/Migrations/*.cs" | head -20
# SQL files
find . -name "*.sql" | head -20
# Schema files
find . -name "schema.*" -o -name "*.prisma" -o -name "*.graphql" | head -10
```

Record in `.aid/knowledge/data-model.md`.

### Step 7: Integration Surface

Map all external touchpoints:

- APIs consumed (HTTP clients, SDK usage).
- APIs exposed (controllers, endpoints, routes).
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS).
- Caches (Redis, Memcached, in-memory).
- Third-party services (auth providers, payment, email).

Record in `.aid/knowledge/api-contracts.md` and `.aid/knowledge/integration-map.md`.

### Step 8: Test Landscape

- Test frameworks in use.
- Test types present (unit, integration, E2E, performance).
- Coverage metrics (if CI reports exist).
- CI/CD pipeline description.

Record in `.aid/knowledge/test-landscape.md`.

### Step 9: Tech Debt Audit

Flag concrete issues with file references:

- Large files (>500 lines) that likely need decomposition.
- Circular dependencies between modules.
- Missing tests in critical paths.
- Outdated package versions with known vulnerabilities.
- TODO/HACK/FIXME comments.

```bash
# Large files
find . -name "*.cs" -o -name "*.java" -o -name "*.ts" | \
  xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -20
# TODOs
rg "TODO|HACK|FIXME|XXX" --count-matches 2>/dev/null | sort -t: -k2 -rn | head -20
```

Record in `.aid/knowledge/tech-debt.md` with risk ratings (High/Medium/Low).

### Step 10: Additional Information

Produce `.aid/knowledge/additional-info.md` with structured Q&A entries for everything that code analysis alone couldn't determine. Each entry includes:

- **ID:** Q{N} (sequential)
- **Question:** What needs to be clarified
- **Category:** Architecture / Infrastructure / Security / Data / Business / Integration / Process / UI-UX / Performance / Testing
- **Impact:** High / Medium / Low
- **Status:** Pending / Answered / Skipped
- **Context:** Evidence from code that raised the question
- **Suggested Answer:** (optional) Best guess from code analysis
- **Actual Answer:** (filled when answered)

This covers business rules not explicit in code, deployment procedures not captured in scripts, data flows requiring human explanation, security model details, and any assumptions made during discovery. These feed directly into aid-interview.

### Step 11: KB Index

Create `.aid/knowledge/README.md` with completeness tracking:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base — {Project Name}

| Document | Status | Last Updated | Source |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| architecture.md | ✅ Complete | {date} | aid-discover |
| coding-standards.md | ⚠️ Partial | {date} | aid-discover (inferred) |
| domain-glossary.md | ❌ Missing | — | Needs interview |
```

## Output

A `.aid/knowledge/` directory containing the relevant subset of these 15 documents (plus a README.md index):

| Document | Always? | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| README.md | Yes | Index with completeness status |
| architecture.md | Yes | Patterns, layers, boundaries |
| module-map.md | Yes (if >1 module) | Module inventory |
| technology-stack.md | Yes | Full stack catalog |
| coding-standards.md | Yes | Inferred conventions |
| data-model.md | If DB exists | Schema and relationships |
| api-contracts.md | If APIs exist | External API surface |
| integration-map.md | If integrations exist | Third-party services |
| domain-glossary.md | Rarely from code | Business terms (usually from interview) |
| test-landscape.md | Yes | Test infrastructure |
| security-model.md | If auth exists | Security architecture |
| tech-debt.md | Yes | Known debt with risk ratings |
| infrastructure.md | If infra is visible | Hosting, deployment |
| ui-architecture.md | If frontend exists | Component tree, state management, design system, routing, a11y, styling |
| additional-info.md | Yes | Structured Q&A — gaps, assumptions, clarifications with impact tracking |

## Targeted Discovery (Re-entry)

When triggered by a GAP.md or IMPEDIMENT.md from a downstream phase:

1. Read the gap/impediment document to understand exactly what's missing.
2. Focus analysis ONLY on the identified area.
3. Update the specific KB document(s).
4. Update `.aid/knowledge/README.md` with a revision note:
   ```
   | {date} | {source phase} | Updated {document} — {what changed and why} |
   ```
5. Update `.aid/knowledge/README.md` status for affected documents.
6. Report completion to the calling phase so it can resume.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every KB document has a clear scope — no overlap between documents.
- [ ] Claims are grounded in code evidence (file paths, line numbers, grep results).
- [ ] Inferred information is marked as inferred (e.g., "⚠️ Inferred from code — needs confirmation").
- [ ] `additional-info.md` captures everything that requires human input with structured Q&A entries.
- [ ] `README.md` accurately reflects completeness status.
- [ ] `README.md` includes a revision history section with the initial discovery entry.

## Feedback Loops

This phase is the **target** of feedback loops from all downstream phases. It does not itself trigger upstream revision (it's the first phase).

When any downstream phase identifies a KB gap:
- If the gap is in a specific document → update that document.
- If the gap reveals a new area not yet covered → create the missing document.
- Always update README.md status and revision history.

## Why This Phase Exists

You can't write a useful spec for a system you don't understand. Most enterprise work is brownfield — an existing codebase with patterns, conventions, and tech debt that will shape every decision downstream. Discovery transforms "a repo we don't fully understand" into "a Knowledge Base that grounds every subsequent phase."

Without Discovery, specs are generic and agents improvise. With Discovery, specs reference actual code patterns and agents follow real conventions.

## Related Phases

- **Next:** [Interview](../aid-interview/) — uses `additional-info.md` from the KB to focus requirements gathering
- **Triggered by:** Any downstream phase via GAP.md with `discovery-needed`
