# Package & Ship

Final verification, PR creation, delivery summary, and documentation updates. The last development phase before production monitoring.

## Core Principle

**Nothing ships without final verification.** Even if each task passed its own review and testing, the combined delivery must pass as a whole. Integration issues only surface when all pieces come together.

## Inputs

- Feature branch with all completed, reviewed, and tested tasks.
- `DELIVERY-{id}.md` — delivery scope and success criteria.
- `REVIEW.md` files — review results for each task.
- `TEST-REPORT.md` — test results from staging validation.
- `SPEC.md` + `.aid/knowledge/` — for documentation updates.

## Prerequisites

Before starting deployment:

- [ ] All tasks in the delivery are status "Complete."
- [ ] All tasks passed review with grade A- or above.
- [ ] Testing phase (aid-execute) passed — TEST-REPORT.md is green.
- [ ] No open IMPEDIMENT.md files blocking this delivery.
- [ ] No open GAP.md files blocking this delivery.

If any prerequisite fails, do not proceed. Resolve the blocking issue first.

## Process

### Step 1: Final Verification

Run the complete verification suite — not just the tests added in this delivery.

```bash
# Full build (all projects, not just changed ones)
dotnet build --no-incremental  # or npm run build, mvn clean compile

# Full test suite
dotnet test  # or npm test, mvn test

# Lint/format check
dotnet format --verify-no-changes  # or eslint, prettier --check
```

**All tests must pass.** Zero failures, zero errors, zero warnings.

If final verification fails:
1. Identify the failing test(s).
2. Determine if it's a regression (existing test broke) or integration issue (tasks conflict).
3. Fix on the feature branch.
4. Re-run full verification.
5. If the fix is non-trivial, loop back to aid-execute for the fix.

### Step 2: Delivery Summary

Generate a summary of what this delivery contains:

```markdown
# Delivery Summary — {Delivery ID}: {Name}

## Scope
{One paragraph: what this delivery adds}

## Tasks Completed
| Task | Description | Complexity | Review Grade |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| task-F1 | Data model for recordings | S | A |
| task-F2 | Repository layer | M | A- |
| task-F3 | API endpoints | L | A |

## Changes
- Files changed: {count}
- Lines added: {count}
- Lines removed: {count}
- Tests added: {count}
- Total test count: {before → after}

## Spec Revisions During Delivery
| Rev | Source | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| 1.1 | GAP-001 | Added latency requirements |

## KB Updates During Delivery
| Document | Change | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| coding-standards.md | Added FluentValidation convention | aid-execute |

## Known Issues
{Any P3+ issues deferred to next delivery}
```

### Step 3: PR Creation

Create a Pull Request with a structured description:

```markdown
## Delivery {id}: {Name}

### What
{Delivery scope — what this PR adds}

### Tasks
- [x] task-F1: {name} (Grade: A)
- [x] task-F2: {name} (Grade: A-)
- [x] task-F3: {name} (Grade: A)

### Verification
- Build: ✅ zero errors, zero warnings
- Tests: ✅ {count} pass ({new} new)
- Lint: ✅ clean
- Staging: ✅ TEST-REPORT.md passed

### Review Notes
{Any notable decisions, trade-offs, or deferred issues}

### References
- DELIVERY-{id}.md
- SPEC.md rev {version}
- TEST-REPORT.md
```

### Step 4: Documentation Updates

Check if implementation revealed anything that should update the KB:

1. **New conventions discovered** → update `.aid/knowledge/coding-standards.md`.
2. **Architecture changed** → update `.aid/knowledge/architecture.md`.
3. **New integrations added** → update `.aid/knowledge/integration-map.md`.
4. **Tech debt created or resolved** → update `.aid/knowledge/tech-debt.md`.
5. **Data model changed** → update `.aid/knowledge/data-model.md`.

Add revision entries to `.aid/knowledge/README.md` for any KB changes.

### Step 5: Artifact Status Updates

1. Update `DELIVERY-{id}.md`:
   - Status: Complete
   - Completion date
   - Final test count
   - Any deferred issues

2. Update each `task-{id}.md`:
   - Status: Complete

3. Update `SPEC.md` revision history if any revisions occurred during this delivery.

4. Update `.aid/knowledge/README.md` if any KB documents were updated.

## Output

- Pull Request ready for merge.
- Delivery summary document.
- Updated DELIVERY-{id}.md (status: Complete).
- Updated task-{id}.md files (status: Complete).
- Updated KB documents (if applicable).
- Updated KB README.md revision history (if applicable).

## Post-Deploy

After the PR is merged:

1. **Verify CI/CD** — ensure the main branch build passes.
2. **Tag/release** — if this delivery is a release milestone.
3. **Notify stakeholders** — share the delivery summary.
4. **Plan next delivery** — if more deliveries remain in the spec.
5. **Trigger aid-track** — begin production monitoring.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All tasks complete and reviewed (A- or above).
- [ ] Testing phase passed (TEST-REPORT.md green).
- [ ] Full build passes (not incremental).
- [ ] Full test suite passes (not just new tests).
- [ ] Lint/format clean.
- [ ] PR created with structured description.
- [ ] Delivery summary generated.
- [ ] DELIVERY and TASK statuses updated.
- [ ] KB updated with any new discoveries.
- [ ] Revision log entries added for all KB changes.
- [ ] No open GAPs or IMPEDIMENTs blocking this delivery.

## Why This Phase Exists

Deploy is more than `git merge`. It's the moment where implementation becomes official: final verification with a clean build, structured PR with full traceability, KB updates reflecting what was learned during this delivery, and artifact status updates closing the loop on tasks and deliverables.

The delivery summary and KB updates are especially important — they capture the delta between what was planned and what was actually built, keeping the KB current for the next cycle.
