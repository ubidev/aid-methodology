# AID — AI-Integrated Development

**A Complete Methodology for AI-Integrated Software Development**

*Version 3.0 — March 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

AID (AI-Integrated Development) is a structured methodology for building and maintaining software with AI agents. It defines nine sequential phases organized into four groups — from problem mapping through production monitoring and issue routing — with formal feedback loops that allow any phase to revise upstream artifacts when reality contradicts assumptions.

Each phase is **co-executed by human and AI**. The AI is the Iron Man suit — it amplifies the human's capabilities. The human is the pilot — setting direction, making decisions, approving advancement between phases. The human never leaves the cockpit. This is not "AI executes, human validates." It is "human and AI work together, human drives."

The methodology covers the full lifecycle:

- **Define** (3 phases): Understand the system, gather requirements, and formalize the problem statement.
- **Map** (2 phases): Plan the roadmap and detail the execution.
- **Execute** (3 phases): Build, review, and test.
- **Deliver** (3 phases): Deploy, monitor, and classify issues.

Bugs take a short path back through implementation. Change requests start a new development cycle. Nothing falls on the floor.

The methodology is built on three convictions:

1. **Understanding precedes specification.** You cannot write a useful spec for a system you don't understand. Brownfield projects (90% of enterprise work) require structured discovery before anything else.
2. **Specs are hypotheses, not contracts.** Implementation reveals truths that specification cannot anticipate. A methodology without formal revision protocols is a methodology that produces silent workarounds and hidden debt.
3. **The Knowledge Base is the gravitational center.** Not the spec. Not the code. The accumulated understanding of the project — architecture, conventions, domain language, tech debt — persists across phases, sprints, and team changes.

This document defines the complete methodology: philosophy, phases, artifacts, feedback loops, and practical guidance for adoption.

## 1. Philosophy

### It's Waterfall. And That's the Point.

Understand → Specify → Plan → Build → Verify → Ship.

This is the Waterfall sequence. We embrace it deliberately.

Waterfall failed not because the sequence was wrong, but because humans couldn't execute it fast enough to afford iteration. When discovery takes weeks and specs take days, going back to fix a wrong assumption costs a sprint. Teams learned to skip forward, hack around problems, and call it "agile."

AI changes the economics:

- **Discovery** that took weeks takes hours. An agent can scan a 21GB codebase, map its architecture, catalog its conventions, and produce a Knowledge Base in a single session.
- **Specification** that took days takes minutes. With a Knowledge Base as context, generating a grounded spec is a single prompt, not a week of meetings.
- **Iteration is cheap.** Feedback loops cost tokens, not sprints. Going back to Discovery to fill a knowledge gap costs pennies, not calendar weeks.
- **Documents don't rot.** The same agents that write code maintain the Knowledge Base and specs. They don't get stale because maintaining them is nearly free.

Agile was the right answer to Waterfall's execution problem. AI is the right answer to Agile's rigor problem. AID is Waterfall with AI execution and formal feedback loops — the methodology that finally works because the bottleneck shifted from "humans are slow" to "humans set direction."

### Human-in-the-Middle

Every phase is co-executed by human + AI. Not "AI executes, human rubber-stamps." Not "human does the thinking, AI does the typing." The human and AI work together within each phase, with the AI amplifying the human's capabilities.

**Between phases, the human gives the OK to advance.** The pipeline never auto-advances. The human reviews the phase output, decides if it's good enough, and greenlights the next phase. This is the checkpoint that keeps the human in control without slowing the work to human speed.

**The roles:**
- **Human:** Pilot. Sets direction, makes judgment calls, holds accountability, approves phase transitions.
- **AI:** Iron Man suit. Amplifies capability — scans codebases in hours, generates specs in minutes, implements tasks, runs reviews, monitors production. Does what the human directs, faster and more thoroughly than the human alone could.

This framing matters. The AI is not autonomous. The AI is not a junior developer that needs supervision. The AI is a power multiplier that makes the human dangerous.

### Three Core Principles

**1. Knowledge Before Specification**

Every methodology tells you to "write good specs." None tells you how to understand a system well enough to write them. AID does. The Discovery phase produces a Knowledge Base — a structured collection of documents covering architecture, conventions, data models, integrations, tech debt, and domain language. The spec is then written *against* this knowledge, not from imagination.

**2. Specs Are Living Documents**

A spec written before implementation is a hypothesis. A spec revised after implementation is knowledge. AID treats specs as living artifacts with formal revision protocols. Every change is tracked, justified, and approved. This isn't chaos — it's controlled evolution.

**3. Feedback Over Forward-Only**

The pipeline is sequential by default, but any phase can trigger upstream revision through structured protocols. Discovery can be re-entered from any phase. Specs can be revised during planning. Tasks can be amended during implementation. The revision trail provides audit transparency while keeping the project moving.

### Roles

AID defines three roles:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Director** | A human. Sets direction, makes decisions, reviews artifacts, approves phase transitions. Spends 2-3 hours/day orchestrating, not coding. |
| **Orchestrator** | An AI agent (or human). Manages the pipeline: spawns agents, routes feedback loops, enforces quality gates, maintains the Knowledge Base. |
| **Specialist** | An AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or similar). Executes tasks within defined scope. Reports impediments rather than working around them. |

The Director never writes code. The Specialist never makes architectural decisions. The Orchestrator bridges both.

## 2. The Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base (`.aid/knowledge/`) is the gravitational center of the entire methodology. Every phase reads from it. Any phase can trigger updates to it.

```

### Completeness Is Tracked

The `README.md` at the root of the Knowledge Base tracks what exists and what's missing:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base — {Project Name}

| Document | Status | Last Updated | Source |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| architecture.md | ✅ Complete | Mar 16 | aid-discover |
| coding-standards.md | ⚠️ Partial | Mar 16 | aid-discover (inferred) |
| domain-glossary.md | ❌ Missing | — | Needs interview |
| security-model.md | ❌ Missing | — | Needs interview |
```

### Not Every Document Is Required

The Discovery phase assesses the project and generates what's relevant:

- **Simple CLI tool?** Maybe 5 documents.
- **Enterprise monorepo?** All 13.
- **Greenfield?** Only `technology-stack.md`, `coding-standards.md`, and `domain-glossary.md` — populated from the interview, not from code.

### Context Feeding Strategy

The Knowledge Base is the project's memory. But memory only works if agents know where to look.

A common failure mode: an agent receives a task spec and the project spec, implements something technically correct — and violates a convention documented in `coding-standards.md` that it never saw. The agent didn't know the document existed. The fix goes through review, gets rejected, comes back, gets redone. Waste.

**AID solves this with the KB Index — a lightweight map of the entire Knowledge Base.**

The Discovery phase generates `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md` as its final step. This file contains a 2-3 line summary of each KB document — what it covers, when to consult it. It costs almost nothing to include in an agent's context, but it gives the agent the ability to self-serve.

```markdown
# Knowledge Base Index — {Project Name}

Use this index to find the right document before making assumptions.
If your task touches an area covered here, read the relevant document first.

| Document | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| architecture.md | MVVM + Clean Architecture layers. Service registration in ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs. Navigation via INavigationService. |
| coding-standards.md | PascalCase for public, _camelCase for fields. Result<T> for error handling. No exceptions for flow control. Async suffix on all async methods. |
| data-model.md | SQLite via EF Core. 8 entities. Soft deletes on Recording and Transcript. Migrations in /Migrations. |
| module-map.md | 12 modules. Core (services), UI (views/viewmodels), Infrastructure (data access), Tests. Module dependency diagram. |
| ... | ... |
```

**The feeding protocol:**

1. **Every task receives INDEX.md.** Always. It's the map. Cost: ~200-500 tokens. Value: the agent knows where to look.
2. **The orchestrator selects 2-4 relevant KB docs** based on the task's domain (data work → data-model.md, API work → api-contracts.md).
3. **The task template includes a search instruction:** "If you need context not provided, consult `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md` and read the relevant document before making assumptions."
4. **Review validates context usage.** One review criterion: did the agent use available KB context, or did it guess?

This is RAG by convention — not embeddings and vector databases, but predictable file structure and an index that agents can navigate. The agent has filesystem access. It can read on demand. It just needs to know the menu.

**Why not a vector database?** Because the KB is small enough (13 documents, typically 2-20KB each) that convention beats infrastructure. The agent can read any document in milliseconds. The bottleneck isn't retrieval speed — it's knowing what exists. The INDEX solves that.

**When does the INDEX update?** Every time Discovery runs — either full or targeted. The INDEX is regenerated from the current state of the KB. It's never manually maintained.

### The KB Outlives the Project

The Knowledge Base is institutional memory. It outlives any individual session, sprint, or developer. When a new team member joins — human or AI — they read the KB and have the project's full context. When a feature request arrives six months later, the KB tells you what the system looks like now, not what the spec said it should look like.

## 3. The Nine Phases

AID organizes nine phases into four groups. The pipeline is linear with feedback loops. The Monitor phase observes production and routes issues back into development through one of two paths:

- **Bug path (short):** Monitor → Execute → Deploy. Surgical. Monitor identifies the bug, performs root cause analysis, creates a task, and routes to Execute. No re-specification, no re-planning.
- **Change Request path (full cycle):** Monitor → Discover. The CR enters as a new project, running the complete pipeline from the beginning.

---

### Group 1: Define

*Understand the system, gather requirements, and formalize the problem statement.*

---

#### Phase 1: Discover (`aid-discover`)

**Purpose:** Understand the existing system. Produce the Knowledge Base.

**Input:** Access to the codebase (git repo, file system, or archive).

**Process:**
1. **Structure scan** — Detect project type, map folder layout, list modules/packages.
2. **Architecture analysis** — Identify patterns, layers, boundaries, data flow.
3. **Stack inventory** — Languages, frameworks, versions, build tools, runtime.
4. **Convention mining** — Naming patterns, error handling, logging, config management (inferred from code).
5. **Module mapping** — Every module: purpose, dependencies, size, test coverage.
6. **Data model extraction** — Schema, entities, relationships, migrations.
7. **Integration surface** — External APIs, message queues, caches, third-party services.
8. **Test landscape** — Frameworks, coverage metrics, test types, CI/CD pipeline.
9. **Tech debt audit** — Large files, circular dependencies, missing tests, outdated packages.
10. **Gap identification** — What we couldn't determine from code alone → feeds into Interview.
11. **Context Index generation** — Generate `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md` with a 2-3 line summary of every KB document produced. This lightweight index is included in every task context so agents know what's available and can self-serve additional context on demand. See [Context Feeding Strategy](#context-feeding-strategy).

**Output:** `.aid/knowledge/` directory — the project's Knowledge Base, including INDEX.md.

**When to skip:** Pure greenfield projects with no existing code. Interview populates a minimal KB instead.

**When to re-enter:** Any downstream phase discovers the KB is wrong or incomplete. Re-entry is always *targeted* — fill the specific gap, not redo full discovery.

#### Phase 2: Interview (`aid-interview`)

**Purpose:** Gather requirements and decompose them into features. Produce REQUIREMENTS.md and per-feature SPEC.md stubs.

**Input:** KB (if brownfield) or project description (if greenfield). A human to interview.

**Workspace:** Each interview creates a *work* — a self-contained unit of scope inside `.aid/`:

```
.aid/
  knowledge/                    ← shared KB (from Discovery)
  work-001-user-auth/           ← one work per interview
    INTERVIEW-STATE.md          ← process tracking (section status, Q&A, grade)
    REQUIREMENTS.md             ← product (stakeholder requirements)
    features/
      feature-001-login/
        SPEC.md                 ← requirements side (from Interview) + tech spec (from Specify)
      feature-002-password/
        SPEC.md
```

Multiple works can coexist — a client requests auth now, reporting later. Each work has its own requirements and features, sharing the same KB.

**Process:**

The interview has six states, advancing one per run:

**States 1–4: Conversational interview.** One question at a time. Starts broad (Objective, Problem Statement) and gets specific (Constraints, Acceptance Criteria). When KB exists (brownfield), questions come with suggested answers and source citations: `[From: .aid/knowledge/{source}.md]` with options to accept, skip, or provide a custom answer. Nothing is silently inferred. Concludes with an approval gate.

**State 5: Feature Decomposition.** After REQUIREMENTS.md is approved, the agent proposes a feature breakdown from §5 Functional Requirements. Each approved feature gets its own folder with a SPEC.md containing the requirements side (description, user stories, priority, acceptance criteria). The technical specification section is left empty — that's Specify's job.

**State 6: Cross-Reference.** Validates REQUIREMENTS.md against the full KB. Checks for contradictions, gaps, missing evidence, and staleness. Assigns a grade (A–D) based on findings. Grade is a snapshot — doesn't change within the same run.

| Grade | Questions | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| A | 0 | Consistent with KB, no questions |
| B | 1–3 | Small gaps or refinements |
| C | 4–7 | Significant gaps or contradictions |
| D | 8+ | Serious consistency problems |

**REQUIREMENTS.md sections:** Objective, Problem Statement, Users & Stakeholders, Scope (In/Out), Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Constraints, Assumptions & Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, Priority. A Change Log at the top tracks every modification.

**Key behaviors:**
- One question at a time. Humans think better with focused prompts.
- Each answer shapes the next question. Adaptive, not scripted.
- Brownfield interviews are shorter (KB pre-fills technical context). Greenfield are longer.
- KB findings are never silently inferred — always presented as suggested answers for user confirmation.
- Downstream phases (Specify, Plan) can inject Q&A entries into INTERVIEW-STATE.md for the next cross-reference run.

**Output:** `.aid/{work}/REQUIREMENTS.md` + `.aid/{work}/features/feature-NNN-{name}/SPEC.md` (requirements side only).

**Feedback to Discovery:** If an answer reveals the KB is wrong or incomplete, the interview pauses, triggers targeted discovery, then resumes with corrected understanding.

#### Phase 3: Specify (`aid-specify`)

**Purpose:** Technical refinement of a single feature through conversational collaboration with the developer. The agent acts as a tech lead — proposes concrete solutions grounded in the KB and codebase, discusses trade-offs, and writes the technical specification into the feature's SPEC.md.

**Input:** A feature's SPEC.md (requirements side, from Interview) + `.aid/knowledge/` directory + codebase.

**What this is:** Agile refinement for AI-augmented teams. Interview captured *what* the stakeholder wants. Specify determines *how* to build it — one feature at a time, through discussion with the developer.

**The universal loop:** Each technical section follows the same cycle that drives all design phases:

1. **Propose** — the agent proposes a concrete solution referencing specific files, classes, patterns, and conventions from the codebase.
2. **Discuss** — the developer validates, adjusts, or redirects. The agent pushes back on contradictions, presents trade-offs, adapts.
3. **Write** — the agreed section is written to SPEC.md.
4. **Review** — the agent verifies what was written against KB reality and other completed sections. Pass → next section. Fail → back to Propose with findings.

**Re-run = enter at step 4 with existing content.** Running `/aid-specify` on a completed feature reviews all sections against current reality (KB, codebase, requirements). Grades A–D. The same loop handles both creation and maintenance.

**What makes this different from generic spec generation:** The agent doesn't ask "what technology do you want to use?" — it proposes based on what the KB and codebase already show. "I see you use Spring Boot with JPMS modules. Here's how this feature fits into the existing module structure." The developer validates, not dictates.

**Process:** One feature per run. Determines applicable sections: 3 core (Data Model, Feature Flow, Layers & Components) always present, plus up to 20 conditional sections activated by context (API Contracts, UI Specs, Events, Security, Migration, etc.). Then runs the loop for each section in order.

**Output:** `## Technical Specification` section added to `.aid/{work}/features/feature-NNN/SPEC.md` — Data Model, Feature Flow, Layers & Components, plus activated conditional sections. Each feature's SPEC.md now contains both the requirements (from Interview) and the technical specification.

**Feedback loops:**
- KB wrong or incomplete → fix directly or write Q&A to DISCOVERY-STATE.md for targeted re-discovery.
- Requirements wrong or incomplete → fix directly or write Q&A to INTERVIEW-STATE.md for targeted re-interview.
- Spike needed → pause feature, record what needs investigation.
- Feature needs to be split or merged → create/merge feature folders, redistribute content.

---

### Group 2: Map

*Define the roadmap and decompose into executable tasks.*

---

#### Phase 4: Plan (`aid-plan`)

**Purpose:** Sequence features into deliverables — each one a functional MVP that builds on the previous. Plan answers ONE question: *"In what order do we deliver, and does each delivery stand on its own?"*

**Input:** Feature SPECs (all with `Ready` status from Specify) + REQUIREMENTS.md + KB (architecture, module-map, tech-debt).

**The universal loop:** Each deliverable follows the same cycle:

1. **Propose** — the agent maps dependencies and proposes a deliverable grouping.
2. **Discuss** — the developer negotiates: move features, reorder, split, merge, defer, change priority. The agent checks dependencies on every adjustment.
3. **Write** — the agreed deliverable is saved to PLAN.md.
4. **Review** — the agent verifies the deliverable is standalone-functional with satisfied dependencies. Pass → next deliverable. Fail → back to Propose with findings.

**Re-run = enter at step 4 with existing PLAN.md.** Reviews each deliverable against current SPECs and KB. Grades A–D.

**What Plan does NOT do** (already covered by Specify): module mapping, test scenarios, per-feature risks and trade-offs, spikes, technical details. Plan only adds the *sequencing* dimension.

**Output:** `.aid/{work}/PLAN.md` — ordered deliverables (each a shippable MVP), optional cross-cutting risks, optional deferred features list.

**Feedback loops:**
- KB insufficient for dependency analysis → Q&A to DISCOVERY-STATE.md.
- SPEC ambiguous about what a feature needs/enables → Q&A to feature's STATE.md.
- Requirements priority unclear → Q&A to INTERVIEW-STATE.md.

#### Phase 5: Detail (`aid-detail`)

**Purpose:** Break each deliverable into small, sequential, testable tasks. Each task = one agent session = one PR = one human review. The ultimate breakdown.

**Input:** `.aid/{work}/PLAN.md` + feature SPECs + KB (architecture, module-map, coding-standards).

**The universal loop:** Each deliverable follows the same cycle:

1. **Propose** — the agent proposes a sequential task breakdown for a deliverable.
2. **Discuss** — the developer and agent refine: size, scope, sequence, acceptance criteria. Split, merge, reorder until right.
3. **Write** — the agreed task files are saved.
4. **Review** — the agent verifies: sequence holds, no gaps, scope aligned with SPECs, criteria testable. Pass → next deliverable. Fail → back to Propose with findings.

**Re-run = enter at step 4 with existing tasks.** Reviews tasks against current PLAN.md and SPECs. Grades A–D.

**Detail is pure breakdown.** No new decisions — everything is already in PLAN + SPECs. Detail just slices deliverables into tasks small enough for an agent to execute in one session.

**Task format:** Four sections — ID/title, source (feature + deliverable), scope (boundary), acceptance criteria (concrete, testable). Nothing else.

**Output:** `.aid/{work}/tasks/task-{id}.md` files — sequential tasks numbered globally across all deliverables.

**Feedback loops:**
- Plan too vague to decompose → return to `/aid-plan`.
- SPEC missing detail for scope → Q&A to feature's STATE.md.
- KB gap → Q&A to DISCOVERY-STATE.md.

---

### Group 3: Execute

*Build, review, and test the code.*

---

#### Phase 6: Execute (`aid-execute`)

**Purpose:** Execute tasks based on their type. Not just coding — every task has a type that
determines what the agent does and how the reviewer evaluates it.

**Task Types:**
- **RESEARCH** — investigate, compare options, document findings
- **DESIGN** — mockups, wireframes, UI prototypes, interaction flows
- **IMPLEMENT** — write code + unit tests
- **TEST** — integration, E2E, UI, load tests
- **DOCUMENT** — ADRs, API docs, runbooks, diagrams
- **MIGRATE** — data migration scripts, schema changes
- **REFACTOR** — restructure code without changing behavior
- **CONFIGURE** — config files, CI/CD, environment setup

**Input:** `task-{id}.md` (with Type field) + per-feature `SPEC.md` + `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md`.

**Process (universal loop, all types):**
1. Read task type and load relevant KB docs via INDEX.md.
2. Execute according to type-specific rules (code, tests, research, design, etc.).
3. Verify relevant gates pass (build, lint, tests — as applicable to the type).
4. Dispatch separate reviewer agent (clean context) with type-specific review criteria.
5. Grade using deterministic rubric. Present all issues to user.
6. Fix CODE issues automatically. Route TASK/SPEC/KB issues as loopbacks.
7. Loop until grade ≥ minimum. Circuit breaker after 3 cycles.

**Branch isolation:** One branch per delivery (`aid/delivery-NNN`). All tasks in a
delivery share the branch. RESEARCH and DOCUMENT tasks that produce only `.aid/`
artifacts may skip branching.

**Impediment protocol:** When the agent discovers assumptions don't hold, it generates
`IMPEDIMENT.md` rather than silently working around the problem.

**Output:** Artifacts appropriate to the task type. Grade ≥ minimum. Review history in STATE.md.

---

### Group 4: Deliver

*Ship, monitor, and classify issues.*

---

#### Phase 7: Deploy (`aid-deploy`)

**Purpose:** Package, verify, and ship the completed delivery to production.

**Input:** Tested code (TEST-REPORT.md passed) + all previous artifacts.

**Process:**
1. **Final verification:** Full build + complete test suite. Zero failures.
2. **Delivery summary:** Files changed, features added, test delta, spec revisions.
3. **PR creation:** Structured description referencing delivery, tasks, test results.
4. **Documentation updates:** Ensure KB reflects any discoveries from implementation.
5. **Artifact status update:** Mark delivery and tasks complete.

**Output:**
- Pull Request ready for merge.
- `DELIVERY-{id}.md` updated with completion status.
- KB updated with any new discoveries.
- Delivery summary for stakeholder communication.

#### Phase 8: Monitor (`aid-monitor`)

**Purpose:** Observe production, classify findings, and route actions. Combines telemetry interpretation with triage in a single observe → classify → act cycle. Per-work scope.

**Input:** Telemetry, error logs, issue tracking, performance metrics, user feedback, CI/CD results + `.aid/knowledge/` + per-feature SPECs.

**Process:**
1. **Observe** — Pull from configured sources. Detect anomalies vs. baseline. Correlate signals across sources ("error spike started 23 min after deploy of package-002").
2. **Classify** — For each finding: BUG (spec right, code wrong), CR (spec needs change), INFRASTRUCTURE (ops), or NO ACTION (false positive).
3. **Analyze** — Root cause analysis for bugs: trace → fault → scope → test requirements.
4. **Propose** — Present findings with routing recommendations to the user.
5. **Act** — Create tasks for bugs (→ aid-execute), Q&A entries for CRs (→ aid-discover), escalate infra.

**Key distinction:** Monitor *interprets*, it doesn't just collect. A dashboard shows you a spike. Monitor tells you "error rate increased 340% after deploy #47, concentrated in the payment module, affecting ~2,000 users" — and then classifies it as a BUG with root cause analysis and patch scope.

**Bug vs. CR:** If the spec said "do X" and the code doesn't do X — bug. If users now need Y instead of X — CR, even if the code "works."

**The short path:** BUG → new task → aid-execute → aid-deploy. The short path skips specification and planning because the spec is already correct — only the code is wrong.

**When to trigger:** On deployment, on schedule, on alert threshold, or on-demand.

**Output:** `MONITOR-STATE.md` — observation log, active findings with classification/evidence/severity/routing, resolved findings.

---

## 4. Feedback Loops

The pipeline is sequential by default. But real engineering isn't linear. Assumptions break. Gaps appear. Production reveals truths that development couldn't anticipate. AID defines formal feedback loops — eight within development and three connecting production back to development.

### The Eleven Loops

#### Development Loops (1-8)

#### Loop 1: Interview → Discovery

**Trigger:** During the interview, a human's answer reveals the KB is wrong or incomplete.

**Protocol:** Interview pauses → targeted discovery on the specific area → KB updated → interview resumes with corrected understanding.

#### Loop 2: Specify → Discovery

**Trigger:** Writing the spec exposes insufficient understanding of a subsystem.

**Protocol:** Specify pauses → `GAP.md` generated with type `discovery-needed` → targeted discovery → KB updated → specify resumes.

#### Loop 3: Plan → Discovery

**Trigger:** Planning reveals that the codebase is more complex than the KB captured.

**Protocol:** `GAP.md` generated → targeted discovery → KB updated → planning resumes.

#### Loop 4: Plan → Specify

**Trigger:** The KB is complete, but the SPEC is ambiguous or contradictory.

**Protocol:** `GAP.md` with type `ambiguity` or `contradiction` → spec revision (possibly with targeted interview) → planning resumes.

#### Loop 5: Detail → Plan

**Trigger:** The plan is too vague to decompose into tasks. Deliverables are too broad, module boundaries unclear, or test scenarios don't map to features.

**Protocol:** Detail documents the gap → Plan revises the specific section → Detail resumes.

#### Loop 6: Implement → Discovery / Plan / Spec

**Trigger:** The agent discovers that assumptions don't hold in the actual codebase.

**Protocol:** `IMPEDIMENT.md` generated → if KB gap, update KB → if resolvable within scope, resolve and document → if requires plan/spec change, pause and escalate.

#### Loop 7: Review → Any Upstream Phase

**Trigger:** Review finds issues that trace to KB, spec, or plan problems — not just code quality.

**Protocol:** Issues tagged by source (CODE/TASK/SPEC/KB/ARCHITECTURE). CODE issues are fixed in-cycle. Everything else pauses the pipeline and escalates.

#### Loop 8: Test → Implement

**Trigger:** Tests fail due to implementation bugs discovered in staging.

**Protocol:** Failures documented in TEST-REPORT.md → route back to `/aid-execute` for fix → `/aid-execute` (re-run).

#### Post-Production Loops (9-11)

#### Loop 9: Monitor → Execute (Bug Path)

**Trigger:** Monitor classifies a finding as BUG.

**Protocol:** Monitor performs root cause analysis, creates a task in `.aid/{work}/tasks/`, routes to aid-execute → aid-deploy. The short path.

#### Loop 10: Monitor → Discover (Change Request Path)

**Trigger:** Monitor classifies a finding as Change Request.

**Protocol:** Monitor writes Q&A entry to DISCOVERY-STATE.md → new cycle starts at aid-discover (or aid-interview for greenfield) → full pipeline.

### The Revision Trail

Every change to an upstream artifact is tracked at the bottom of the artifact:

```markdown
## Revision History

| Rev | Date | Source | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| 1.0 | Mar 1 | aid-specify | Initial spec |
| 1.1 | Mar 5 | GAP-001 (aid-plan) | Added latency requirements |
| 1.2 | Mar 8 | IMP-003 (aid-execute) | Changed sync model |
```

### Feedback Loop Artifacts

**GAP.md** — Generated by Specify, Plan, Detail, or Review when upstream artifacts are deficient.

```markdown
# GAP: GAP-001
**Source:** aid-plan, Deliverable 2
**Type:** discovery-needed | ambiguity | contradiction
**Description:** Module map shows 3 consumers of SearchService, but grep reveals 11.
**KB Gap:** module-map.md (incomplete)
**Blocking:** Deliverable 2 scoping

### The Two Post-Production Paths

**Bug path (short):** Monitor → Execute → Deploy. Three phases to fix. Monitor maps the root cause — diagnosis, files to touch, tests to add — and hands it to Implement as a task. No re-specification, no re-planning.

**Change Request path (full):** Monitor → Discover. The CR enters the development pipeline as a new project. It gets its own requirements, its own spec, its own plan. The full pipeline ensures that changes are understood before they're built.

### Flow Rules

1. **Linear by default.** Discover → Interview → Specify → Plan → Detail → Execute → Deploy → Monitor.
2. **Human approves each phase transition.** The pipeline never auto-advances.
3. **Feedback to KB.** Any phase can trigger targeted discovery. The KB is always the return target.
4. **Feedback to Spec.** Plan, Detail, Implement, Review, and Test can trigger spec revision.
5. **Greenfield starts at Interview** with minimal KB populated from answers.
6. **Brownfield starts at Discover** with full KB populated from code.
7. **Each phase produces persistent artifacts.** Each artifact has a revision history.
8. **The KB outlives the project.** It's institutional memory for future work.
9. **Bugs take the short path.** Implement → Review → Test → Deploy. No re-specification.
10. **CRs take the full path.** Monitor routes to Discover. New cycle, new spec, new plan.
11. **Track runs continuously.** It monitors production on schedule or on deployment.
12. **Detail feeds Implement.** Plan feeds Detail. Strategy flows down; tactics flow up when strategy is insufficient.

## 7. Case Studies

### VivaVoz — Greenfield Desktop Application

**Context:** MVVM desktop app (Avalonia/.NET) for voice recording and transcription. Built from scratch.

**How AID applied:**

- **Discovery:** Skipped (greenfield). Minimal KB populated during interview.
- **Interview:** Full requirements gathering. User personas, feature priority, platform constraints.
- **Specify:** PRD.md as initial spec. Detailed architecture decisions: MVVM pattern, SQLite storage, Whisper integration.
- **Plan:** High-level roadmap: MVP (core recording), v2 (transcription), v3 (export). Module identification, test scenarios.
- **Detail:** Decomposed into deliveries (2a: core recording, 2b: transcription, 2c: file management, 2d: import/export). Each with task specs including C# interface contracts.
- **Implement:** Agent-per-task execution. Parallel implementation of independent features.
- **Review:** 1,184 tests (unit + E2E). Code review with grading system.
- **Test:** Staging validation of each delivery increment.
- **Deploy:** Incremental deliveries. Each delivery merged independently.

**What worked:** The two-level planning (Plan → Detail) meant strategic decisions were separated from tactical decomposition. The plan defined "what goes in MVP" while detail defined "how to build each piece."

### Case Study 1 — Brownfield Enterprise Java

**Context:** 21GB enterprise Java codebase (Maven/Tycho, OSGi bundles). Client needed a developer to understand and extend the search engine.

**How AID applied:**

- **Discovery:** Full codebase analysis. Module listing across hundreds of packages. Architecture report covering 15 sections.
- **Interview:** Targeted — client explained business context, search requirements. Short interview because Discovery pre-filled all technical context.
- **Specify:** Spec grounded in the KB. Referenced actual package names, existing interfaces, OSGi service bindings.

**Key insight:** Without Discovery, an agent dropped into this codebase would have hallucinated. The KB gave agents the context they needed to work within the existing architecture rather than against it.

### Zac Pipeline — Operational Automation

**Context:** E-commerce advertising pipeline. Pull data from Meta/Google/Klaviyo, validate, process with specialist AI agents, grade output quality.

**How AID applied:**

- **Interview:** One question at a time. "What are your brands?" → "What platforms?" → "What does a good report look like?" → "What data don't you agree with?" That last question discovered a timezone bug.
- **Specify:** Pipeline spec with data flow, agent roles, grading criteria.
- **Implement:** Multi-agent orchestration: 4 specialist agents + orchestrator + executive summary generator.
- **Test:** Domain-specific quality gate (Grade A) checking: source match (1% tolerance), traceability, cross-agent consistency.
- **Track:** Monitors quality gate results across brands. When a report fails, Triage determines if it's a data processing bug (short path) or a source format change (full cycle).

## 8. Comparison with SDD

### What is SDD?

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is the practice of using specifications as the primary development artifact, with AI agents implementing code from specs. Key tools: GitHub Spec Kit, AWS Kiro, Tessl Framework.

### Where We Overlap

Both AID and SDD:
- Use specifications as the central development artifact.
- Employ AI agents for code implementation.
- Rely on tests as contracts between spec and code.
- Require human review of agent output.
- Use markdown as the specification format.

### Where We Diverge

| Dimension | SDD | AID |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Starting point** | A spec | Understanding (Discovery) |
| **Brownfield support** | Gap acknowledged | First-class Discovery phase with 13-document KB |
| **Spec philosophy** | Spec is source of truth | Spec is hypothesis — revised by formal protocol |
| **Requirements** | Assumed to exist | Gathered through adaptive interview |
| **Planning depth** | Single spec | Two-level: Plan (strategy) → Detail (tactics) |
| **Feedback loops** | Rebuild spec from scratch | Eleven formal loops (8 dev + 3 post-production) |
| **Testing** | Not addressed as separate phase | Dedicated staging/E2E phase between review and deploy |
| **Quality gates** | Generic conformance tests | Domain-specific grading (Grade A system) |
| **Agent model** | One agent per spec | Multi-agent orchestration with specialists |
| **Delivery model** | Spec → code → done | Spec → plan → detail → implement → review → test → deploy |
| **Memory** | Stateless | Knowledge Base persists across sessions |
| **Post-delivery** | Not addressed | Monitor → Execute (bugs) / Discover (CRs) |
| **Scope** | Code generation | Full lifecycle: discovery through production maintenance |
| **Human role** | Spec writer, reviewer | Co-pilot across all phases |

### The Core Argument

SDD says: "Write better specs, get better code."

We say: "Understand the system first. Then write specs grounded in that understanding. Then plan the roadmap. Then detail the execution. Then build with quality gates. Then review against the spec. Then test in staging. Then ship. And when any of that reveals you were wrong — revise formally, don't hack around it."

SDD is not wrong. It's incomplete. AID is SDD + Discovery + Feedback Loops + Two-Level Planning + Staging Validation + Institutional Memory + Production Lifecycle.

## 9. Adoption Guide

### Starting with an Existing Project (Brownfield)

1. Run `aid-discover` on the codebase. This produces your Knowledge Base.
2. Review the KB. Fill gaps with human knowledge.
3. For the next feature request, run `aid-interview` with the stakeholder.
4. Run `aid-specify` with REQUIREMENTS.md + KB as input.
5. Run `aid-plan` to define the roadmap.
6. Run `aid-detail` to decompose into tasks.
7. Run `aid-execute` for each task.
8. Review is built into `aid-execute` (code → review → fix → done).
9. Run `aid-execute` to validate in staging.
10. Run `aid-deploy` to package and ship.

### Starting a New Project (Greenfield)

1. Run `aid-interview` with the stakeholder. This is your starting point.
2. A minimal KB is populated from interview answers.
3. Run `aid-specify` with REQUIREMENTS.md + minimal KB.
4. Continue with Plan → Detail → Implement → Review → Test → Deploy.
5. The KB grows organically as the codebase develops.

### Adopting Incrementally

You don't need to use all eight phases from day one:

- **Start with Detail + Implement.** If you already have specs, just formalize your task decomposition and agent execution.
- **Add Review.** Introduce the grading system and spec-anchored review.
- **Add Test.** Add staging validation between review and deploy.
- **Add Plan.** Separate strategy from tactics with two-level planning.
- **Add Discover.** For the next brownfield project, run Discovery first.
- **Add Interview.** For the next client project, use the adaptive interview.
- **Add Track + Triage.** Once you're shipping, add production monitoring and issue classification. Triage closes the bug loop — root cause analysis routing directly back to implementation.
- **Go full pipeline.** Once each phase is familiar, run them sequentially with feedback loops.

### Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping Discovery on brownfield.** Agents will hallucinate about your architecture.
- **Treating the spec as sacred.** It's a hypothesis. Revise it when implementation proves it wrong.
- **Ignoring impediments.** If an agent reports an impediment, stop and decide. Don't let it work around the problem.
- **Skipping Review.** "The tests pass" is not enough. Spec-anchored review catches issues that tests can't.
- **Skipping Test.** Review catches what code looks like. Test catches what code does. Both are necessary.
- **Not maintaining the KB.** A stale KB is worse than no KB. Every phase should update it when new knowledge is acquired.
- **Sending agents blind.** Including TASK + SPEC without the KB INDEX means the agent doesn't know what context exists. It will guess instead of look. Always include INDEX.md.
- **Auto-advancing between phases.** The human approves every transition. That's the checkpoint that keeps the methodology safe.
