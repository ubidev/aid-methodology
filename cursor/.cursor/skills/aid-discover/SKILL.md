# Brownfield Codebase Discovery

Analyze an existing codebase and produce a structured `knowledge/` directory. If the Task tool
is available, orchestrate 5 specialized discovery agents in parallel. Otherwise, generate all
documents sequentially in the main context. Includes a built-in quality gate that reviews, grades,
and fixes KB documents.

**State machine — each `/aid-discover` run does ONE step and exits.**

## ⚠️ Subagent Support Note

Cursor supports agents via `.cursor/agents/` and the `Task` tool, but sub-agent dispatch is
experimental (Task tool may not be available in all builds as of Mar 2026).

**If Task tool IS available:** Dispatch the 5 discovery agents in parallel (Steps 1-5 below).
**If Task tool is NOT available:** Generate all 13 documents sequentially in the main context,
following the same prompts described in Steps 1-5 but executing them yourself directly.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `--grade X` | Set minimum acceptable grade. Format: `[A-F][-+]?` (e.g., A, A-, B+). Default: `A`. Persists in DISCOVERY-GRADE.md — user doesn't need to repeat it. |
| `--reset` | Clear entire `knowledge/` directory and restart from scratch. |

**Grade persistence:**
- When DISCOVERY-GRADE.md doesn't exist yet: the `--grade` value is saved into the file as "Minimum Grade"
- When DISCOVERY-GRADE.md already exists: if `--grade` is provided, it UPDATES the minimum in the file. If not provided, the minimum is READ from the file.

---

## State Detection

Read the filesystem to determine which mode to enter:

```
State 1: Missing KB docs           → GENERATE mode
State 2: All docs, no GRADE file   → REVIEW mode
State 3: GRADE file, grade < min   → FIX mode
State 4: GRADE file, grade >= min  → DONE
```

**Detection logic:**

1. Check `knowledge/` for the 13 expected documents:
   ```
   architecture.md, technology-stack.md, module-map.md, coding-standards.md, data-model.md,
   api-contracts.md, integration-map.md, domain-glossary.md, test-landscape.md,
   security-model.md, tech-debt.md, infrastructure.md, open-questions.md
   ```
2. If any are missing → **GENERATE**
3. If all 13 exist but `knowledge/DISCOVERY-GRADE.md` does not exist → **REVIEW**
4. If `knowledge/DISCOVERY-GRADE.md` exists:
   - Read the current overall grade and minimum grade
   - If `--grade` was provided, update the minimum grade in the file
   - Compare current grade against minimum (use grade ordering below)
   - If current grade < minimum → **FIX**
   - If current grade >= minimum → **DONE**

**Grade ordering** (highest to lowest):
`A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F`

Print the detected state: `[State: {GENERATE|REVIEW|FIX|DONE}]`

---

## Mode: GENERATE

Generate missing KB documents. Skip any that already exist.

**Agent dispatch:** Steps 1-5 reference discovery agents (e.g., discovery-architect).
If the Task tool is available, dispatch them via `Task(agent="discovery-architect", prompt="...")`.
If the Task tool is NOT available, execute each step's prompt yourself directly in the main context.

### Step 0: Check Existing KB

Scan `knowledge/` for existing files. Build a list of what exists vs. what's missing.

Print: `[0/13] Checking existing KB...`

If ALL 13 documents exist and no `--reset` was requested, report KB is complete and skip
directly to Step 6 (README.md and INDEX.md regeneration).

---

### Step 1: Architecture Analysis

Dispatch **discovery-architect** to produce `architecture.md` and `technology-stack.md`.
Only dispatch if either file is missing.

Print: `[1/5] Dispatching architecture analysis...`

Prompt to pass to the subagent:
> Analyze this codebase and produce knowledge/architecture.md and knowledge/technology-stack.md.
> Cover: project type, folder structure, architectural patterns, module boundaries, data flow,
> DI registration, entry points, tech stack (languages, frameworks, versions, package managers,
> runtime, build tools, dev tooling). Write only to the knowledge/ directory.

Wait for completion. Verify both files exist before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Module and Convention Analysis

Dispatch **discovery-analyst** to produce `module-map.md`, `coding-standards.md`, and `data-model.md`.
Only dispatch if any of those files are missing.

Print: `[2/5] Dispatching module and convention analysis...`

Prompt to pass to the subagent:
> Analyze this codebase and produce knowledge/module-map.md, knowledge/coding-standards.md,
> and knowledge/data-model.md. Map every module (purpose, size, dependencies, test coverage).
> Mine coding conventions from actual code — naming, error handling, logging, config, file
> organization. Extract data models: schemas, relationships, migrations, indexes, validation.
> Write only to the knowledge/ directory.

Wait for completion. Verify files before proceeding.

---

### Step 3: Integration Mapping

Dispatch **discovery-integrator** to produce `api-contracts.md`, `integration-map.md`, and `domain-glossary.md`.
Only dispatch if any of those files are missing.

Print: `[3/5] Dispatching integration mapping...`

Prompt to pass to the subagent:
> Analyze this codebase and produce knowledge/api-contracts.md, knowledge/integration-map.md,
> and knowledge/domain-glossary.md. Map APIs exposed and consumed, message queues, caches,
> webhooks, and third-party services. Build a domain glossary from class names, method names,
> constants, and comments that encode business concepts. Write only to the knowledge/ directory.

Wait for completion. Verify files before proceeding.

---

### Step 4: Quality Assessment

Dispatch **discovery-quality** to produce `test-landscape.md`, `security-model.md`, and `tech-debt.md`.
Only dispatch if any of those files are missing.

Print: `[4/5] Dispatching quality assessment...`

Prompt to pass to the subagent:
> Analyze this codebase and produce knowledge/test-landscape.md, knowledge/security-model.md,
> and knowledge/tech-debt.md. Assess test frameworks, test types, coverage, CI/CD integration.
> Evaluate security: auth, authorization, secrets management, OWASP concerns. Audit tech debt:
> large files, TODO/FIXME density, missing tests, outdated packages, dead code. Classify all
> debt items with risk ratings (Critical/High/Medium/Low). Write only to the knowledge/ directory.

Wait for completion. Verify files before proceeding.

---

### Step 5: Infrastructure and Gap Analysis

Dispatch **discovery-scout** to produce `infrastructure.md` and `open-questions.md`.
Only dispatch if either file is missing.

Print: `[5/5] Dispatching infrastructure and gap analysis...`

Prompt to pass to the subagent:
> Analyze this codebase and produce knowledge/infrastructure.md and knowledge/open-questions.md.
> Map CI/CD pipelines, Docker/container config, IaC (Terraform, Pulumi, CDK), environments,
> and monitoring. For open-questions.md: capture EVERYTHING that cannot be determined from code
> alone — every uncertainty, assumption, and gap needing human input. Be comprehensive.
> Write only to the knowledge/ directory.

Wait for completion. Verify files before proceeding.

---

### Step 6: Generate README.md and INDEX.md

The orchestrator (you) generates these two documents directly — they are small and require
reading across all previously produced KB documents.

**knowledge/README.md** — completeness tracking table and revision history:
```markdown
# Knowledge Base

## Completeness

| Document | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| architecture.md | ✅ Complete | |
| technology-stack.md | ✅ Complete | |
| module-map.md | ✅ Complete | |
| coding-standards.md | ✅ Complete | |
| data-model.md | ✅ Complete | |
| api-contracts.md | ✅ Complete | |
| integration-map.md | ✅ Complete | |
| domain-glossary.md | ✅ Complete | |
| test-landscape.md | ✅ Complete | |
| security-model.md | ✅ Complete | |
| tech-debt.md | ✅ Complete | |
| infrastructure.md | ✅ Complete | |
| open-questions.md | ✅ Complete | |

## Revision History

| Date | Documents Updated | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| {date} | All (initial discovery) | |
```

**knowledge/INDEX.md** — 2-3 line summary of every KB document for agent self-service:
```markdown
# Knowledge Base Index — {Project Name}

Use this index to find the right document before making assumptions.
If your task touches an area covered here, read the relevant document first.

| Document | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| architecture.md | {2-3 line summary of patterns found and structure} |
| technology-stack.md | {2-3 line summary of stack} |
| module-map.md | {2-3 line summary of modules} |
| coding-standards.md | {2-3 line summary of key conventions} |
| data-model.md | {2-3 line summary of data model} |
| api-contracts.md | {2-3 line summary of API surface} |
| integration-map.md | {2-3 line summary of integrations} |
| domain-glossary.md | {2-3 line summary of key terms} |
| test-landscape.md | {2-3 line summary of test coverage} |
| security-model.md | {2-3 line summary of security posture} |
| tech-debt.md | {2-3 line summary of debt and risk} |
| infrastructure.md | {2-3 line summary of infrastructure} |
| open-questions.md | {2-3 line summary of gaps needing human input} |
```

Regenerate INDEX.md on every discovery run (full or targeted).

---

### Step 7: Update Project Config Files

Scan the project root for `AGENTS.md`. Replace any `<!-- AID:DISCOVER ... -->`
placeholders with real data from the analysis:

- **Project Overview** — project name, purpose, tech stack, target platform
- **Build & Test** — actual build, test, and lint commands (from build scripts, CI config, package manager)
- **Code Conventions** — key naming patterns, formatting rules, idioms found in code
- **Architecture** — high-level summary (layers, modules, entry points)
- **Project description** — project name and one-line description

Keep the `<!-- AID:DISCOVER ... -->` comment above each section so future re-discoveries can update them.
Replace only the `(pending discovery)` placeholder lines with real content.
If a field cannot be determined, leave it as `(not found — check open-questions.md)`.

---

### Step 8: Final Verification

List all 13 expected KB documents. Check each exists. Report any missing.

Print: `[13/13] Generation complete — Knowledge Base ready. Run /aid-discover again to review.`

If any documents are missing, report them and offer to re-dispatch the responsible subagent.

---

## Mode: REVIEW

All 13 KB documents exist. Grade them.

### Step 1: Dispatch the Reviewer

Dispatch **discovery-reviewer** subagent with ALL KB documents as context.

Print: `[Review 1/2] Reviewing Knowledge Base quality...`

Prompt to pass to the subagent:
> Review every document in knowledge/ for quality. Be AGGRESSIVE — a lenient review is worse
> than useless because it lets bad docs through the quality gate.
>
> For each document, assess:
> 1. **Completeness** — Does it cover what it should? Are there obvious gaps?
> 2. **Accuracy (MOST IMPORTANT)** — Do NOT trust what the document says. Verify claims against
>    actual source files. Check version numbers against pom.xml, package.json, MANIFEST.MF,
>    lib/*.jar filenames, lockfiles. Check file paths exist. Check if a "class" is actually an
>    interface. Any factual error is [CRITICAL]. Any "TBD" when the data is extractable is [HIGH].
> 3. **Depth** — Is it surface-level listing or does it show understanding of patterns and relationships?
> 4. **Usefulness** — Would an agent working on this codebase find this document helpful?
> 5. **Evidence** — Are claims grounded in code (file paths, class names) or generic?
>
> Grade each document: A+ (exceptional), A (thorough), B+ (good with minor gaps), B (adequate),
> B- (shallow), C+ (significant gaps), C (barely useful), D (misleading or wrong), F (missing/empty).
>
> **Grade caps (absolute — no exceptions):**
> Multiple [CRITICAL] → max D. One [CRITICAL] → max D+.
> Multiple [HIGH] → max C. One [HIGH] → max C+.
> Multiple [MEDIUM] → max B. One [MEDIUM] → max B+.
> Multiple [MINOR] → max A-. One [MINOR] → max A. Only zero issues = A+.
>
> All issues MUST have severity: [CRITICAL], [HIGH], [MEDIUM], or [MINOR].
>
> **Minimum 15 spot-checks** (verify claims against actual code). At least 5 must be version verifications.
>
> Also review AGENTS.md — are the discovered values accurate and useful?
> Check for error propagation: if one doc has a wrong version, check if other docs repeat it.
>
> Write the full review to knowledge/DISCOVERY-GRADE.md using the DISCOVERY-GRADE.md template format.

Wait for completion.

---

### Step 2: Post-Process DISCOVERY-GRADE.md

Read `knowledge/DISCOVERY-GRADE.md`. Verify it contains:
- [ ] Grade for every document (13 KB docs + AGENTS.md + INDEX.md + README.md)
- [ ] Specific issues with severity levels ([CRITICAL], [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [MINOR])
- [ ] Verification spot-checks (minimum 10)
- [ ] Overall grade and recommendation
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns

Set the Minimum Grade in the file:
- If `--grade` was provided, use that value
- If not, use the default: `A`

Add the first Review History entry.

Print: `[Review 2/2] Review complete. Grade: {overall}. Minimum: {min}. Run /aid-discover again to {fix issues|proceed}.`

**Grade comparison:**
- If overall grade >= minimum → Next run will enter DONE mode
- If overall grade < minimum → Next run will enter FIX mode

---

## Mode: FIX

DISCOVERY-GRADE.md exists but the overall grade is below the minimum.

### Step 1: Identify Documents Below Threshold

Read DISCOVERY-GRADE.md. List all documents graded below the minimum grade.
Prioritize: [CRITICAL] issues first, then [HIGH], then [MEDIUM].

Print: `[Fix] {N} documents below {minimum}. Fixing...`

---

### Step 2: Fix Each Document

For each document below the minimum grade, in priority order:

1. Read the specific issues from the Issues Found section of DISCOVERY-GRADE.md
2. Read the relevant source code to gather missing information
3. Edit the KB document to address the issues — be specific, add evidence (file paths, code references)
4. **REMOVE the fixed issue lines** from the Issues Found section of DISCOVERY-GRADE.md
5. Re-grade the document

Print: `[Fix] Improving {document}... {old grade} → {new grade}`

**IMPORTANT:** When an issue is fixed, its line MUST be removed from the Issues Found section.
DISCOVERY-GRADE.md always reflects the CURRENT state, not history. History is tracked in the
Review History table.

---

### Step 2b: Verify Meta-Documents (MANDATORY after every fix pass)

Fixes to primary KB documents can invalidate derived/meta documents. After ALL primary fixes,
verify and update the following 4 meta-documents **in this order:**

1. **open-questions.md** — Do any fixed issues resolve open questions? Remove answered ones. Did fixes reveal new unknowns? Add them.
2. **INDEX.md** — Do summaries still match the updated document content? Update any stale summaries.
3. **README.md** — Does the completeness table (status/gaps) still reflect reality? Update statuses.
4. **AGENTS.md** — Did fixes change build commands, architecture, conventions, or gotchas? Update if stale.

Print: `[Fix] Verifying 4 meta-documents...`

For each meta-doc, read it, compare against the fixes just made, and update if needed.
If no update is needed, skip silently. If updated, print: `[Fix] Updated {document}`

---

### Step 3: Re-Review (MANDATORY — Do NOT Self-Evaluate)

**After fixing all documents, you MUST re-run the full review process.**
If Task tool is available, dispatch the `discovery-reviewer` agent again.
If Task tool is NOT available, perform the review yourself — but it MUST be a **separate pass**.
Do NOT grade your own fixes in the same turn as writing them. Write all fixes first, then start
a fresh review pass treating the documents as if you're seeing them for the first time.
The agent that wrote the fix CANNOT evaluate its own work. This is a hard rule.

Print: `[Fix 2/3] Re-reviewing after fixes...`

Dispatch **discovery-reviewer** with the same prompt as REVIEW mode Step 1.
The reviewer will overwrite DISCOVERY-GRADE.md with a fresh assessment.

Wait for completion.

---

### Step 4: Post-Fix Update

Read the new DISCOVERY-GRADE.md produced by the reviewer.

1. Verify the Review History was preserved (reviewer should append, not replace)
2. If Review History is missing entries from before the re-review, add them back
3. Ensure the new entry reflects this was a Fix + Re-review cycle

Print: `[Fix 3/3] Complete. Grade: {old} → {new}. Run /aid-discover again to {fix remaining issues|proceed}.`

**If the grade is still below minimum:** The next run will enter FIX mode again. This is expected — some fixes may introduce new issues or the reviewer may catch things the fixer missed. The cycle continues until the grade meets the minimum.

**If documents still have issues after fixing:** The next run will re-enter FIX mode to continue.

---

## Mode: DONE

DISCOVERY-GRADE.md exists and the overall grade meets or exceeds the minimum.

Print: `✅ Discovery complete. Grade: {grade}. Minimum: {minimum}. KB is ready for the Interview phase.`

No action needed. The user can proceed to `/aid-interview`.

---

## Targeted Discovery (Re-entry)

When a GAP.md or IMPEDIMENT.md triggers re-discovery of a specific area:

1. Read the GAP/IMPEDIMENT to understand exactly what's missing
2. Identify which subagent owns the missing documents:
   - `architecture.md`, `technology-stack.md` → dispatch discovery-architect
   - `module-map.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `data-model.md` → dispatch discovery-analyst
   - `api-contracts.md`, `integration-map.md`, `domain-glossary.md` → dispatch discovery-integrator
   - `test-landscape.md`, `security-model.md`, `tech-debt.md` → dispatch discovery-quality
   - `infrastructure.md`, `open-questions.md` → dispatch discovery-scout
3. Dispatch ONLY the relevant subagent for the area that needs updating
4. Regenerate README.md and INDEX.md (orchestrator does this directly)
5. Update `knowledge/README.md` revision history with the targeted update
6. Delete `knowledge/DISCOVERY-GRADE.md` so the next run re-reviews
7. Report completion to the calling phase

---

## Grading Criteria

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A+ | Exceptional — comprehensive, accurate, evidence-rich, immediately useful |
| A | Thorough — covers expected scope with solid evidence |
| B+ | Good — minor gaps or missing details that don't block work |
| B | Adequate — covers basics but lacks depth in important areas |
| B- | Shallow — lists things without explaining patterns or relationships |
| C+ | Significant gaps — missing important sections or inaccurate in places |
| C | Barely useful — an agent would need to re-discover most information |
| D | Misleading — contains wrong information that could cause bad decisions |
| F | Missing or empty |

**Overall grade** = weighted average where architecture, module-map, and coding-standards
count double (they're referenced most by downstream phases).
